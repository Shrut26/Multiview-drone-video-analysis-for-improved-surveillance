# Multiview-drone-video-analysis-for-improved-surveillance.
This project focuses on developing an algorithm which performs object detection and tracking in real time on 80 different classes of object using OpenCV and YOLOv3
<h2>About The Project</h2>

This project focuses on developing an algorithm which can enhance the present security and surveillance systems by performing tasks like object detection and object tracking on the set of inputs given, taken mainly through a drone. Various methods were explored while deciding which combination of models for object detection and object tracking gives us the best desirable result. The object detection task is performed using the YOLOv3 model which gives us the respective class along with the confidence score of the object present in the video as the output. The task of object tracking is performed using the concept of centroid-based tracking algorithm, which can do the tracking of multiple objects present in the input video belonging to different classes by providing the coordinates of the moving object and a bounding box with a unique id assigned to it.
